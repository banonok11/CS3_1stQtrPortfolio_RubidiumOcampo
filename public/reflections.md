# Reflections

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
1. **Variable Declaration** - I clearly understand how to declare variables in JavaScript. For me, this is the most basic topic in this quarter and also in previous years.

2. **Data Types** - The main types of data are strings, numbers, and boolean. Other data types include undefined, null, and Symbol. I know how to identify different data types, and use them properly in my codes.

3. **Control Statements (if, else)** - If, else if, and else statements are used to make decisions for executing different actions in a program. These statements make it possible for the code to follow different paths depending on a condition.

4. **Loop Control Structures** - For and while loops are used to repeat actions in a code. For loops are used when you know the number of iterations to be used. While loops are for repeating statements as long as a certain condition is met.

5. **JavaScript Operators** - Examples of operators in JavaScript are  +, -, *, /, and %. Since we have already discussed this topic in previous years, I was already familiar with them. The only operator I wasn't familiar with was === because we did not use this before. 

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **Functions**
    * I only know how to code simple functions
    * I need more practice use them more effectively

2. **Arrays**
    * I still don't clearly understand how nested arrays work.

3. **HTML Tags**
    * I always forget which tags to use in my code.

4. **HTML Events**
    * I need more practice because I am still not familiar with these.

5. **Break and Continue**
    * I sometimes forget when to use them and how to use them.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. I will practice creating programs that use complex functions.
2. I will research how nested arrays work, and how I can use them in my code.
3. I will study the use of each HTML tag so that I know which ones to use in my code.
4. I will review how to use event handlers.
5. I will search up program examples online to see how break and continue are used.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### Effective Activities
1. **Graded and Non-graded Coding Exercises** - These exercises helped me practice how to apply what was discussed in class. They also helped me identify my mistakes and learn how to fix them
2. **Lectures with practice** - Similar to the coding exercises, lectures with practice help me how to apply what we learned in class right away. These make it easier for me remember what we learned, so I find it effective.

### Not Effective Activities
1. **Pure Lectures** - If I just read lectures without actually coding, it wouldn't be effective for learning. I find it harder to remember details if I don't actually code it.
2. **Long Demonstrations** - Watching the teacher demonstrate how to code certain program without actually coding it ourselves isn't effective. It is helpful to see how it works, but not being able to try it doesn't help with remembering the details and information.
